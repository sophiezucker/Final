		<p>When Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had to come up with a blockbuster in celebration of the Met’s 150th anniversary in 2020 — a blockbuster to follow the blockbusters that were about 
			<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/style/met-museum-costume-institute-catholicism.html" target="_blank">Catholicism</a> and 
			<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/arts/design/met-costume-institute-camp-2019-spring-show.html" target="_blank">camp</a>; a blockbuster to do what blockbusters do, which is lure people into the museum — he was stumped.</p>

		<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/fashion/metropolitan-museum-of-art-costume-institute-blockbuster-about-time.html">“I wanted to do an exhibition focused on the collection, but not a traditional masterworks exhibition. Something that connects to the zeitgeist, and what people are talking about now. I think it’s about time.”</blockquote>

		<p>About time for what?</p>

		<p>Literally, about time.</p>

		<p>On Thursday, the museum will reveal its next big costume exhibition: “About Time: Fashion and Duration.” It is inspired in part by the novels of Virginia Woolf and the theories of the early-20th-century French philosopher Henri Bergson, whose admittedly somewhat obscure but also important musings on time posited it as a constantly mutating stream rather than a series of discrete moments.</p>

		<p>The show, which opens on May 7, will feature 160 pieces of women’s fashion from the last 150 years, and beyond.</p>

		<p>“Fashion is indelibly connected to time,” Mr. Bolton said. “It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times.” And it is, like most industries, currently having an existential crisis centered on the entire question of time.

		Designers complain endlessly that they have too little of it to be creative. Consumers complain that they don’t want to wait six months to buy a dress they like now.</p>

		<p>The show will be designed by Es Devlin, who created the sets for Beyoncé’s “Formation” tour, as well as many Royal Opera House productions. The catalog will contain a new short story written in the show’s honor by Michael Cunningham, the author of the “Mrs. Dalloway”-inspired novel “The Hours.”</p>

		<p>It all sounds awfully … well, time-consuming. Visitors may find this concept even more elusive than that of this year’s camp show, which drew people in and frustrated them in equal measure. Mr. Bolton doesn’t mind.</p>

		<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/fashion/metropolitan-museum-of-art-costume-institute-blockbuster-about-time.html">“As a curator, I don’t believe in presenting exhibits that are conclusive. I like them to be open-ended.”</blockquote>

		<p>He added, however, that working on the show had “made me realize more than ever that the clock and the calendar — especially the 24/7 time of digital capitalism — is one of the main contributing factors to the creative exhaustion that many designers are feeling at the moment.”</p>

		<p>The show will be chaired by Nicolas Ghesquière of Louis Vuitton (the brand is also underwriting the exhibition, because, you know, travel, time and so on), Emma Stone (a Vuitton ambassador), Meryl Streep (who starred in “The Hours”), Lin-Manuel Miranda (because he showed everyone that Hamilton was modern) and Anna Wintour (duh).</p>
